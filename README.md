# Weekly-Project-3-U2--Java

In this exercise, we were asked to build a Java application, following a certain number of 'design pattern' such as:
  - Observer Pattern
  - Factory Pattern
  - Proxy Pattern
  
This program 'simulate' a fire system algorithm, where a main central station receive and monitor (observer) four differents 'probes'.
When the sent data of one of these probes detect a 'smoke level' of a certain amount (>= 5), then the central station set an alarm and simulate
an http request, logging the value in the console.
